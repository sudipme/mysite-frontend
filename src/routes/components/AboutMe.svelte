        <br /><br />
        I'm currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in Computer Science at the
        Indian Institute of Information Technology, Sri City.
        <br /><br />
        One of my favorite aspects of being a computer science student is participating
        in weekly coding contests. These challenges allow me to apply my problem-solving
        skills, algorithmic thinking, and programming prowess to real-world scenarios.
        <br /><br />
        Machine learning is a domain that truly excites me. I am actively investing
        time and effort into understanding the intricacies of ML algorithms, techniques,
        and their practical applications.
